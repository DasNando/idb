Lamott has described why she writes: <blockquote>I try to write the books I would love to come upon, that are honest, concerned with real lives, human hearts, spiritual transformation, families, secrets, wonder, craziness\u2014and that can make me laugh. When I am reading a book like this, I feel rich and profoundly relieved to be in the presence of someone who will share the truth with me, and throw the lights on a little, and I try to write these kinds of books. Books, for me, are medicine.<ref>{{cite_web |url=http://religion.beloblog.com/archives/2008/02/quote_of_the_day_60.html |work=Religion Blog |publisher=Dallas Morning News |date=2008-02-10 |title=Quote of the Day}}</ref></blockquote> 
Lamott is cited as a writer who captures well the style of narrative nonfiction called [[Literary particularism|particularism]], coined by Howard Freeman.<ref name=prweb>Rice, Priscilla.
