    "description": "Information and communications technologies (ICTs) and the new economy they herald are generally either glorified as unprecedented opportunities for post-industrial enfranchisement, or vilified as a mirage conjured up for their own ends by those who run the world. This book sets out to review the relationship between information technologies and society. It examines the development of ICTs, and explores the ways in which they are used to subjugate workers, manipulate consumers, and extend media monopolies and commercial control. Heavily steered as they are towards the interests of the state and corporate sectors Francois Fortier argues that ICTs currently do little more than polarize economic and political power in an anti-democratic fashion. Yet alternative forms and uses of ICTs do exist and have been promoted by progressive social sectors for nearly two decades. Concluding with a study of these initiatives, Fortier proposes a new political economy of ICTs, aimed at facilitating rather than obstructing democracy.",

While once the printed page was the basic medium and was archived by libraries, now the record exists in a number of locations and in many cases is not printed. Preservarion is now a matter of identification of the item in the first place, the location is not always so obvious; then ascertaining the preservation policy of the \"keeper\" - who may not be the owner; ensuring that there will be preservation or archiving and keeping track of the technology so that the item can be read in the future, despite obsolescence or other technology changes. This work covers the viewpoints of various technologies which are important in the preservation process.",

The Sciences of the Earth follow: geography and cartography, geology, seismology and mineralogy. Dr Needham distinguishes parallel traditions of scientific cartography and religious cosmography in East and West, discussing orbocentric wheel-maps, the origins of the rectangular grid system, sailing charts and relief maps, Chinese survey methods, and the impact of Renaissance cartography on the East. Finally-and here Dr Needham's work has no Western predecessors-there are full accounts of the Chinese contribution to geology and mineralogy.",

    "description": "As Dr Needham's immense undertaking gathers momentum it has been found necessary to subdivide volumes into parts, each to be bound and published separately. The first part of Volume 4, already published, deals with the physical sciences; the second with the diverse applications of physics in the many branches of mechanical engineering; and the third will deal with civil and hydraulic engineering and nautical technology. With this part of Volume 4, then, we come to the application by the Chinese of physical principles in the control of forces and in the use of power; we cross the frontier separating tools from the machine. We have already noticed that the ancient Chinese concept of chhi (somewhat similar to the pneuma of the Greeks) asserted itself prominently in acoustics; but we discover here that the Chinese tendency to think pneumatically was also responsible for a whole range of brilliant technological achievements, for example, the double-acting piston-bellows, the rotary winnowing-fan, and the water-powered metallurgical blowing-machine (ancestor of the steam-engine); as well as for some extraordinary insights and predictions in aeronautics.",

    "description": "Personhood is considered at once a sign of legal-political status and of socio-cultural agency, synonymous with the rational individual, subject, or citizen. Yet, in an era of life-extending technologies, genetic engineering, corporate social responsibility, and smart technology, the definition of the person is neither benign nor uncontested. Boundaries that previously worked to secure our place in the social order are blurring as never before. What does it mean, then, to be a person in the twenty-first century? In Impersonations, Sheryl N. Hamilton uses five different kinds of persons - corporations, women, clones, computers, and celebrities - to discuss the instability of the concept of personhood and to examine some of the ways in which broader social anxieties are expressed in these case studies. She suggests that our investment in personhood is greater now than it has been for years, and that our ongoing struggle to define the term is evident in law and popular culture. Using a cultural studies of law approach, the author examines important issues such as whether the person is a gender-neutral concept based on individual rights, the relationship between personhood and the body, and whether persons can be property. Impersonations is a highly original study that brings together legal, philosophical, and cultural expressions of personhood to enliven current debates about our place in the world.",

Reflecting the trend to optimization through integrative approaches for engine, driveline and vehicle control, this valuable book enables control engineers to understand engine and vehicle models necessary for controller design and also introduces mechanical engineers to vehicle-specific signal processing and automatic control. Emphasis on measurement, comparisons between performance and modelling, and realistic examples derive from the authors’ unique industrial experience . The second edition offers new or expanded topics such as diesel-engine modelling, diagnosis and anti-jerking control, and vehicle modelling and parameter estimation.

    "description": "Long before the United States became a major force in global affairs, Americans believed in their superiority over others due to their inventiveness, productivity, and economic and social well-being. U.S. expansionists assumed a mandate to \"civilize\" non-Western peoples by demanding submission to American technological prowess and design. As an integral part of America's national identity and sense of itself in the world, this civilizing mission provided the rationale to displace the Indians from much of our continent, to build an island empire in the Pacific and Caribbean, and to promote unilateral--at times military--interventionism throughout Asia. In our age of \"smart bombs\" and mobile warfare, technological aptitude remains preeminent in validating America's global mission. Michael Adas brilliantly pursues the history of this mission through America's foreign relations over nearly four centuries from North America to the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. The belief that it is our right and destiny to remake foreign societies in our image has endured from the early decades of colonization to our current crusade to implant American-style democracy in the Muslim Middle East. \"Dominance by Design\" explores the critical ways in which technological superiority has undergirded the U.S.'s policies of unilateralism, preemption, and interventionism in foreign affairs and raised us from an impoverished frontier nation to a global power. Challenging the long-held assumptions and imperatives that sustain the civilizing mission, Adas gives us an essential guide to America's past and present role in the world as well as cautionary lessons for the future.",

    "description": "The essays in this volume explore how two domains of human experience and action--religion and technology--are implicated in each other. Contrary to commonsense understandings of both religion (as an \"otherworldly\" orientation) and technology (as the name for tools, techniques, and expert knowledges oriented to \"this\" world), the contributors to this volume challenge the grounds on which this division has been erected in the first place. What sorts of things come to light when one allows religion and technology to mingle freely? In an effort to answer that question, Deus in Machina embarks upon an interdisciplinary voyage across diverse traditions and contexts where religion and technology meet: from the design of clocks in medieval Christian Europe, to the healing power of prayer in premodern Buddhist Japan, to 19th-century Spiritualist devices for communicating with the dead, to Islamic debates about kidney dialysis in contemporary Egypt, to the work of disability activists using documentary film to reimagine Jewish kinship, to the representation of Haitian Vodou on the Internet, among other case studies. Combining rich historical and ethnographic detail with extended theoretical reflection, Deus in Machina outlines new directions for the study of religion and/as technology that will resonate across the human sciences, including religious studies, science and technology studies, communication studies, history, anthropology, and philosophy.",

    "description": "Today we commonly describe ourselves as machines that \"let off steam\" or feel \"under pressure.\" The Lives of Machines investigates how Victorian technoculture came to shape this language of human emotion so pervasively and irrevocably and argues that nothing is more intensely human and affecting than the nonhuman. Tamara Ketabgian explores the emergence of a modern and more mechanical view of human nature in Victorian literature and culture. Treating British literature from the 1830s to the 1870s, this study examines forms of feeling and community that combine the vital and the mechanical, the human and the nonhuman, in surprisingly hybrid and productive alliances. Challenging accounts of industrial alienation that still persist, the author defines mechanical character and feeling not as erasures or negations of self, but as robust and nuanced entities in their own right. The Lives of Machines thus offers an alternate cultural history that traces sympathies between humans, animals, and machines in novels and nonfiction about factory work as well as in other unexpected literary sites and genres, whether domestic, scientific, musical, or philosophical. Ketabgian historicizes a model of affect and community that continues to inform recent theories of technology, psychology, and the posthuman. The Lives of Machines will be of interest to students of British literature and history, history of science and of technology, novel studies, psychoanalysis, and postmodern cultural studies.",

    "description": "In Ways of Knowing, John V. Pickstone provides a new and accessible framework for understanding science, technology, and medicine (STM) in the West from the Renaissance to the present. Pickstone's approach has four key features. First, he synthesizes the long-term histories and philosophies of disciplines that are normally studied separately. Second, he dissects STM into specific ways of knowing—natural history, analysis, and experimentalism—with separate but interlinked elements. Third, he explores these ways of knowing as forms of work related to our various technologies for making, mending, and destroying. And finally, he relates scientific and technical knowledges to popular understandings and to politics. Covering an incredibly wide range of subjects, from minerals and machines to patients and pharmaceuticals, and from experimental physics to genetic engineering, Pickstone's Ways of Knowing challenges the reader to reexamine traditional conceptualizations of the history, philosophy, and social studies of science, technology, and medicine.",

    "description": "Privacy is the capacity to negotiate social relationships by controlling access topersonal information. As laws, policies, and technological design increasingly structure people'srelationships with social institutions, individual privacy faces new threats and newopportunities. Over the last several years, the realm of technology and privacyhas been transformed, creating a landscape that is both dangerous and encouraging. Significantchanges include large increases in communications bandwidths; the widespread adoption of computernetworking and public-key cryptography; mathematical innovations that promise a vast family ofprotocols for protecting identity in complex transactions; new digital media that support a widerange of social relationships; a new generation of technologically sophisticated privacy activists;a massive body of practical experience in the development and application of data-protection laws;and the rapid globalization of manufacturing, culture, and policy making. Theessays in this book provide a new conceptual framework for the analysis and debate of privacy policyand for the design and development of information systems. The authors are international experts inthe technical, economic, and political aspects of privacy; the book's strength is its synthesis ofthe three. The book provides equally strong analyses of privacy issues in the United States, Canada,and Europe. Contributors: Philip E. Agre, Victoria Bellotti, Colin J. Bennett,Herbert Burkert, Simon G. Davies, David H. Flaherty, Robert Gellman, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, DavidJ. Phillips, Rohan Samarajiva.",

    "description": "Is Science Multicultural? explores what the last three decades of European/American, feminist, and postcolonial science and technology studies can learn from each other. Sandra Harding introduces and discusses an array of postcolonial science studies, and their implications for \"northern\" science. All three science studies strains have developed in the context of post-World War II science and technology projects. They illustrate how technoscientific projects mean different things to different groups. The meaning attached by the culture of the West may not be shared or may be diametrically opposite in the cultures in other parts of the world. All, however, would agree that scientific projects--modern science included--are \"local knowledge systems.\" The interests and discursive resources that the various science studies bring groups to their projects, and the ways that they organize the production of their kind of science studies, are distinctively culturally-local also. While their projects may be unintentionally converging, they also conflict in fundamental respects. How is this inevitable cultural-situatedness of knowledge both an invaluable resource as well as a limitation on the advance of knowledge about nature? What are the distinctive resources that the feminist and postcolonial science theorists offer in thinking about the history of modern science; the diversity of \"scientific\" traditions in non-European as well as in European cultures; and the directions that might be taken by less androcentric and Eurocentric scientific projects? How might modern sciences' projects be linked more firmly to the prodemocratic yearnings that are so widely voiced in contemporary life? Carefully balancing poststructuralist and conventional epistemological resources, this study concludes by proposing new directions for thinking about objectivity, method, and reflexivity in light of the new understandings developed in the post-World War II world.",

As email and audio/video conferencing technologies expanded the possibilities for education and social interaction, the authors played an active role in shaping and analyzing their use. Looking back on that early formative period and assessing its impact on the present world, the authors evaluate moments of social importance in order to examine the linkages among social practices, Alaskan peoples, and technologies. They consider the power of communication media to cause and ramify change.\"--BOOK JACKET",

What are the effects of China's influence on world ceramics? These questions (and many more) are answered in this lavishly-illustrated history of Chinese ceramic technology. The scene is set through the use of historical texts, archaeological excavation, and the principles of ceramic science. Chapters follow on the formation of clays and their relation to the underlying geologies of China, on firing, on manufacturing methods and sequences, on glazes, pigments and gilding, and on the impact of Chinese ceramic technology around the world, from the seventh to the twenty-first centuries. This is a volume unique in its coverage, which brings together research materials in several languages for the first time.

Providing the sound knowledge base is a driving factor behind a great deal of the ensuing research and forms the content of many of the chapters of this book. The book covers many aspects of mood in performance settings. Chapters focus on the nature of mood, the validity of mood measures and applied research. Theoretical issues on the nature of mood and a conceptual model of mood-performance relationships in sport is reviewed. Chapters include research on relationships between mood and performance, motivation, coping strategies, personality, eating attitudes, humour, and emotional intelligence. Mood responses to intense exercise, extreme environments, aqua-massage, and interventions to enhance mood are also covered. Each chapter provides recommendations for future research.",

    "description": "Baseball and Philosophy brings together two high-powered pastimes: the sport of baseball and the academic discipline of philosophy. Eric Bronson asked eighteen young professors to provide their profound analysis of some aspect of baseball. The result offers surprisingly deep insights into this most American of games. The contributors include many of the leading voices in the burgeoning new field of philosophy of sport, plus a few other talented philosophers with a personal interest in baseball. A few of the contributors are also drawn from academic areas outside philosophy: statistics, law, and history. This volume gives the thoughtful baseball fan substancial material to think more deeply about. What moral issues are raised by the Intentional Walk? Do teams sometimes benefit from the self-interested behavior of their individual members? How can Zen be applied to hitting? Is it ethical to employ deception in sports? Can a game be defined by its written rules or are there also other constraints? What can the U.S. Supreme Court learn from umpiring? Why should baseball be the only industry exempt from antitrust laws? What part does luck play in any game of skill?",

By linking general moral principles and practical cases, the book develops a contemporary theory of fair play. The book examines many of the key issues in the ethics of sport, including: * fairness and justice in sport * moral and immoral interpretation of 'athletic performance' * what makes a 'good competition' * the key values of competitive sport. The notion of fair play is integral to sport as we know and experience it, and is commonly seen as a necessary ethos if competitive sport is to survive and flourish. Fair Play in Sport provides an invaluable guide to the subject for all those with an interest in ethics and the philosophy of sport.",

Philly fans booed Santa, cheered, as Michael Irvin lay motionless on the Vet's hard Astroturf. Sports radio personalities Glen Macnow and Anthony Gargano tell the story from the Philadelphia fan's perspective. In part a Philadelphia sports memoir, The Great Philadelphia Fan Book is also a historical and anecdotal account of the nation's passionate sports fans centering around Philadelphia's four major league teams. The authors mount a sturdy apologia that will be sure to delight Philadelphia sports fans and remind them of their unique and unabashed dedication to their hometown teams.",

Recently, great advances have been made through spatial modelling. This book provides a snapshot of the latest research in modelling technologies and methodologies within five environmental fields; the cryosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation interfaces and urban environments. Spatial Modelling of the Terrestrial Environment deals with the use of remote sensing, numerical models and GIS in addressing important natural and human environmental sciences issues, focusing on the theory and application of modelling remotely sensed data within the context of environmental processes. Extensive case material exemplifies the latest research and modelling paradigms presented in the book.",

    "description": "Why is soccer the sport of choice in South America, while baseball has soared to popularity in the Caribbean? How did cricket become India's national sport, while China is a stronghold of table tennis?In Global Games Maarten Van Bottenburg asserts that it is the \"hidden competition\" of social and international relations, rather than the particular qualities of a given sport, that explains who plays what sport and why. People's different and changing preferences for sports are based on the social and cultural meanings they attribute to each sport, meanings that alter in response to changing relations among groups of people, both social classes and nations. Looking at Britain, Germany, the United States, and Japan - the four centers from which the sports practiced by most people worldwide originate - Van Bottenburg discusses how individual sports developed, what institutions and groups spread them, and why certain sports and not others found a ready audience elsewhere. The nature of the relationship between the country of origin and the adopting country, as well as the international status of each, help determine how successfully a particular sport takes hold and to what degree it is modified by its new practitioners. Other key factors include which groups dominated and promoted the various sports in their countries of origin, which groups appropriated them elsewhere, and the latter's positions within their society's class structure.A detailed and coherent account of the social significance and the politics underlying sports, Global Games demonstrates that sports are not a trivial pursuit but are deeply embedded in the way individuals and nations wish to be perceived.",

    "description": "This collective volume contributes to a growing debate concerning the extent to which we are now living in a global society shaped by sport in addition to economy, technology and so on. It covers 36 countries from five continents, analyzed by 87 contributors, so it offers a large comparative study. It is also a data bank of national information resources for students, researchers, policy-makers, sports leaders and managers. By means of a standard framework used in all chapters, the collected data from national cases on history, management and culture of sport provide interpretations of marketing, sponsorship, finance, target groups, settings for activities, strategy of promotion and social changes as related to Sport for All. This cross-national approach seeks to offer adequate meaning to the practices of each country, stimulating further research on specific themes of physical activities for health and leisure, either in affluent or poor social conditions. The concluding chapter lays the groundwork of Sport for All.",

He shows how demographic growth, evolving spatial arrangements, social reform, the formation of class and ethnic subcultures, the expansion of urban government, and the rise of political machines and crime syndicates all interacted to influence the development of American sport.

    "description": "Sport Worlds: A Sociological Perspectivetakes a novel approach to tracing the intimate and extensive relationships between sport and other social worlds. By examining classic issues and current trends, the text offers students and practitioners alike a broad base of knowledge with which to challenge the everyday conventions and practices of sport. Joseph Maguire, Grant Jarvie, Louise Mansfield, and Joe Bradley deftly highlight the ways in which sport competitions are shaped more by what happens off the field than on. Using contemporary examples, the authors paint a historically relevant picture of how sport is an integral part of the global order, our local communities, and our individual identities. The text includes the following features: -A straightforward organization and easy-to-read style making it an essential reference for students and professionals studying sociology of sport -Clearly stated objectives and review questions at the start and end of each chapter that give readers a framework for learning and understanding key points throughout the text -Project suggestions in each chapter that allow readers to incorporate learning concepts into hands-on, real-life situations, furthering student comprehension -Narrative case studies based on current issues illustrating the global nature of the modern world of sport -Highlighted examples that allow readers to relate today's sport headlines to issues and trends beyond the final score -Debating points that engage readers in thought-provoking discussions, allowing readers to assess the sociology of sport issues for themselves Part I,\"Sport Inside the World,\" examines a range of global systems, processes, and issues that characterize sport worlds. These include networks, boundaries, conventions, and challenges. Attention is given to issues such as migration, the environment, and politics. Part II,“Inside the Worlds of Sport,” focuses on the significance of sport in the emotional and social lives of people. Special focus is on questions of gender, place, space, and identities. Sport Worlds: A Sociological Perspectivekeenly illustrates how sport enters our lives from different paths, giving readers a fresh perspective from which to consider the true character and meaning of sport. For students, researchers, and professionals alike—be they participants, spectators, or consumers of sport—the text is an extensive resource that will enhance their overall experience in the world of sport.",

    "description": "For at least a century, across the United States, Mexican American athletes have actively participated in community-based, interscholastic, and professional sports. The people of the ranchos and the barrios have used sport for recreation, leisure, and community bonding. Until now, though, relatively few historians have focused on the sports participation of Latinos, including the numerically preponderant Mexican Americans. This volume gathers an important collection of such studies, arranged in rough chronological order, spanning the period from the late 1920s through the present. They survey and analyze sporting experiences and organizations, as well as their impact on communal and individual lives. Contributions spotlight diverse fields of athletic endeavor: baseball, football, soccer, boxing, track, and softball. Mexican Americans and Sports contributes to the emerging understanding of the value of sport to minority populations in communities throughout the United States. Those interested in sports history will benefit from the book’s focus on under-studied Mexican American participation, and those interested in Mexican American history will welcome the insight into this aspect of the group’s social history.",

With reverence yet a sharp eye for the influence of big business, corruption, price gouging, political maneuvering, and media grandstanding, Eitzen portrays famous and lesser known events from professional and college sports, including well known coaches and players, to give us a deeper understanding of what sports means to us and how it affects our everyday world.\"--Publisher's description.",

John Major’s period as Prime Minister was a watershed in British sport policy marking the beginning of a prolonged period of public and lottery investment and relatively high political salience. The text also locates Labour sport policy not only in relation to the previous government of John Major, but also in relation to the Labor government’s broader concerns and ambitions related to modernization of British institutions, its ambition to tackle the ‘wicked issues’ epitomized by its focus on achieving greater social inclusion, and its interest in facilitating greater stakeholder involvement in the policy process. Lindsey and Houlihan provide the first analysis that examines sport policy as a field of government and that discusses how the various sectors (e.g. youth/school sport, mass sport, etc.) have been affected by government policy and the competition for public resources.",

    "description": "Philosophy is a crucial, yet often overlooked, part of kinesiology students' education. Practical Philosophy of Sport and Physical Activity, Second Edition,provides students with a thorough, clear, and practical introduction to the philosophy of physical activity and sport, and in doing so, prepares them for the ethical questions they will face as professionals. This second edition has been significantly revised, and it has been enhanced to include the following features: -Expanded instruction on practical ethics in physical activity, guiding students in how to rank values and turn those values into actions -New material that emphasizes physical activity as well as sport, and provides specific holistic techniques for the practitioner in the workplace -In-depth case studies along with discussion questions that can be used to teach students how to follow a philosophical argument and come to their own conclusions The case studies, one on running up the score and the other on performance-enhancing substances, are based on two articles that are reprinted in their entirety in the appendix. Practical Philosophy of Sport and Physical Activity, Second Edition,helps students examine key moral questions in sport. Its approach to the content helps students follow and dissect ethical arguments, think through philosophic issues, and apply theory to practice. Each chapter includes objectives, philosophical exercises, reviews, and study questions to reinforce understanding. Kretchmar's engaging writing style accentuates important topics of discussion, focusing the readers' attention on the philosophy behind the practice or strategy. As a result, students develop their philosophical skills, refine their personal philosophy concerning physical activity and sport, and learn that philosophy can be clear, practical, and holistic, rather than obscure, overly theoretical, and dualistic. The text is arranged in four parts. Part Iintroduces students to the nature and methods of philosophy. Part IIfocuses on issues relating to the nature of the athlete or client and includes analyses of dualism, scientific materialism, and holism. Part IIIdelves into kinesiology issues, including the nature of play, games, and competition, and Part IVprovides expanded material on ethics, value choices, and active lifestyles. This text provides students with the practical tools and specific techniques they need to think ethically and systematically, as they become skilled practitioners in the field of physical activity and sport. In doing so, it demystifies philosophy and reveals it as the guiding element in our understanding of, and approach to, activity, games, and competitions.",

Each chapter includes a definition of terms, an explanation of the chapter's scope, and an outline of the sections. The author then provides a review of the available research and theory on the chapter's main topic, analyzes the state of knowledge in the area, and devotes significant space to future research directions. The book is divided into four parts. Part Ioffers a comprehensive introduction to the field, including definitions, history, and research paradigms and methodologies. Part IIexplores individual characteristics that affect sport participants' behavior, including self-perceptions, attributional patterns and perceptions of control, motivational orientations, and achievement goal perspectives. Part IIIexplores socioenvironmental factors that affect sport participants' behaviors. Part IVdelves into the research and theory concerning intervention techniques used for enhancing performance and modifying athletes' behaviors, including imagery and mental rehearsal, attentional processes, goal setting, and flow and peak performance. Advances in Sport Psychology, Third Edition, offers a new and thorough understanding of where sport psychology has been, where it is now, and where it is headed. This text will help students prepare and conduct their own research, and it will be a great reference for professionals who want to stay on the cutting-edge of the field.",

    "description": "Steven Overman explores the concordant values of the Protestant ethic, capitalism, and sport by applying German scholar Max Weber's seminal thesis. Weber demonstrated a relationship between the Protestant ethic and a form of economic behavior he labeled the \"Spirit of capitalism.\" The work introduces readers to the doctrines and values experience, focusing on the framing of work and play in light of an intense unease with human pleasure and idleness. The United States is portrayed as the quintessential Protestant ethic society. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Sport proposes \"seven Protestant virtues\" built upon rational asceticism and the work ethic that comprise the Protestant ethic. The spirit of capitalism is presented as a derivative of this ethic and a major force in shaping American institutions, notable organized sport. The second part of the book discusses the spirit of American sport as it is manifested in values the author identifies as the American sport ethic: seven constructs that correspond to the seven Protestant \"virtues.\" Each of these constructs, e.g., achieved status, competitiveness, is examined as it has influenced organized sport. The discussion encompasses youth sport, college sport, professional sport, and American influence on the modern Olympics. The book then analyzes sport as a form of consumer capitalism.",

    "description": "Tolkien's concern with time - past and present, real and \"faerie\" - captures the wonder and peril of travel into other worlds, other times, other modes of consciousness. Reading his work, we \"fall wide asleep\" into a dream more real than ordinary waking experience, and emerge with a new perception of the waking world. Flieger explores Tolkien's use of dream as time-travel in his unfinished stories The Lost Road and The Notion Club Papers as well as in The Lord of the Rings and his shorter fiction and poetry. Analyzing Tolkien's treatment of time and time-travel, Flieger shows that he was not just a mythmaker and writer of escapist fantasy but a man whose relationship to his own century was troubled and critical. He achieved in his fiction a double perspective of time that enabled him to see in the mirror of the past the clouded reflection of the present.",

    "description": "When did cigarettes start making an appearance in English literature? Which author's heart was purportedly eaten by a cat? One of our best-known and best-loved literary critics turns his attention to the more bizarre areas of literature in this miscellany of fact and trivia. Which author had the heaviest brain? What was the original title of 1984? Who made the first bouillon soup? What do 12 percent of all winners of the Booker Prize have in common? What didn't happen on Thomas Carlyle's famous wedding night? And, while we're at it, who wrote the first Western, and is there any link between asthma and literary genius? Sutherland's irreverent literary masterpiece illuminates every topic imaginable from author advances to Civil War literature to Victorian sex to odd things eaten by literary characters (think Patrick Bateman's girlfriend in American Psycho). Other fascinating insights include the fact that the number one title among American Civil War soldiers was Les Miserables. This is the ideal anthology of fascinating information and trivia for all book lovers.",

    "publisher": "Stanford University Press",
    "publishedDate": "2007",
    "description": "The late Jacques Derrida’s notion of literature is explored in this new study. Starting with Derrida’s self-professed inability to comment on the work of Samuel Beckett, whom Derrida nevertheless considered one of the most interesting and exemplary writers of our time, Asja Szafraniec argues that the shared feature of literary works as Derrida understands them is a double, juridical-economical gesture, and that one aspect of this notion (the juridical) is more hospitable to Beckett’s oeuvre than the other. She then discusses other contemporary philosophical approaches to Beckett, including those of Gilles Deleuze, Stanley Cavell, and Alain Badiou. The book offers an innovative analysis of Derrida’s approach to literature, as well as an overview of current philosophical approaches to contemporary literature, and a number of innovative readings of Beckett’s work.",

Though it is inter-disciplinary in scope, situated as it is on the borderlines of ontology and logic, philosophy of literature and theory of language, Ingarden's work has a deliberately narrow focus: the literary work, its structure and mode of existence. The Literary Word of Art establishes the groundwork for a philosophy of literature, i.e., an ontology in terms of which the basic general structure of all lliterary works can be determined. This \"essential anatomy\" makes basic tools and concepts available for rigorous and subtle aesthetic analysis.",

From the aunts who encouraged her nascent writing career to the influence of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four on The Handmaid's Tale, we trace the movement of Atwood's fertile and curious mind in action over the years.Atwood's controversial political pieces, Napoleon's Two Biggest Mistakes and Letter to America -- both not-so-veiled warnings about the repercussions of the war in Iraq -- also appear, alongside pieces that exhibit her active concern for the environment, the North, and the future of the human race. Atwood also writes about her peers: John Updike, Marina Warner, Italo Calvino, Marian Engel, Toni Morrison, Angela Carter, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mordecai Richler, Elmore Leonard, and Ursula Le Guin.This is a landmark volume from a major writer whose worldwide readership is in the millions, and whose work has influenced and entertained generations. Moving Targets is the companion volume to Second Words.",

With extraordinary grace and erudition, he ranges in time, place, and subject from Omar Khayyam to Joseph Conrad, from ancient China to modern England, from world revolution to contemporary slang.",

    "description": "Narrative has been central to human life for millennia, and the twentieth century has been preeminently the age of the story. Mass culture and mass leisure have enabled us to spend far more time absorbing stories, real and imaginary, than any of our ancestors. Whether or not this has been to our benefit is one of the questions raised by journalist and 1999 CBC Massey lecturer Robert Fulford. Narrative, Fulford points out, is how we explain, how we teach, how we entertain ourselves — often all at once. It is the bundle in which we wrap truth, hope, and dread. It is crucial to civilization.Fulford writes engagingly and energetically about narrative history, narrative in news coverage, the rise of electronic narrative, and narrative as it flourishes in the form of gossip, \"the folk-art version of literature,\" revealing to us the mystery, power, and importance of story in all our lives.",

    "description": "In Children of Silence distinguished literary critic Michael Wood presents his most wide-ranging work to date. A series of reflections on the literary landscape of our time - from the writings of Roland Barthes to those of Stephen King - the book explores such issues as the shift of interest from novel to story, the blurring of the line between fiction and criticism, the persistence of the notion of paradise, the lure of horror, and the tendency of fiction both to reflect and to resist contemporary history. Children of Silence shows that a living literature is constantly in dialogue with history, both asking history's questions in a different mode and asking the questions that history cannot ask. In an age when literature itself often seems to be threatened, Wood illustrates many of the forms in which literature continues to define the way we see ourselves.",

    "description": "Piranesi builds a shopping mall, Giotto supervises a training analysis, Milton directs a film. In Postmodernism Across the Ages the traditional notion of change in history, the linear analogy of human development, comes in for its own share of interpretation, of reading, and hence doubles back on itself. This provocative collection of essays examines the way in which the concept of postmodernism has forced a rethinking of the intersection of time and text. Appropriately, these essays themselves reach across the ages, considering authors ranging from Alexander the Great, to Chaucer and Milton, to Ford Madox Ford and Umberto Eco. The volume concludes with a series of four dissenting Afterwords that assess the import of these postmodern readings on some of the major interpretive projects of our day: Feminism, Marxism, Humanism and Deconstruction, and Gay Studies.",

Weisberg here names and narrates the central vision of Law and Literature, which he calls poethics: the revival of jurisprudence through literary sources and techniques.",

    "description": "This book is about the literary and friendship networks that were active in Britain for a 250 year period. Patterns in the nature of literary social circles emerge: they may centre upon a location, like Christ Church, or a person, like Aaron Hill; they may suffer stress when private relationships become public knowledge, as Caroline Lamb’s Glenarvon shows; and they may model themselves on a preceding age, as the relationship between the Sidney circle and Lady Mary Wroth exemplifies. Despite these similarities, no two coteries are the same. The circles this volume examines even differ in their acceptance of their own status as a coterie: someone like Constance Fowler was certainly part of a strict familial coterie; the Scriberlians were a more informal set who were also members of other groups; and although Byron’s years of fame are regularly associated with Holland House, he often denied being of their party. With an Afterword by Helen Hackett",

    "publishedDate": "2010",
    "description": "The essays in this volume discuss narrative strategies employed by international writers when dealing with rape and sexual violence, whether in fiction, poetry, memoir, or drama. In developing these new feminist readings of rape narratives, the contributors aim to incorporate arguments about trauma and resistance in order to establish new dimensions of healing. This book makes a vital contribution to the fields of literary studies and feminism, since while other volumes have focused on retroactive portrayals of rape in literature, to date none has focused entirely on the subversive work that is being done to retheorize sexual violence. Split into four sections, the volume considers sexual violence from a number of different angles. 'Subverting the Story' considers how the characters of the victim and rapist might be subverted in narratives of sexual violence. In 'Metaphors for Resistance,' the essays explore how writers approach the subject of rape obliquely using metaphors to represent their suffering and pain. The controversy of not speaking about sexual violence is the focus of 'The Protest of Silence,' while 'The Question of the Visual' considers the problems of making sexual violence visible in the poetic image, in film and on stage. These four sections cover an impressive range of world writing which includes curriculum staples like Toni Morrison, Sarah Kane, Sandra Cisneros, Yvonne Vera, and Sharon Olds.",

    "description": "This volume fulfills the need for a student edition of Horace's literary epistles, which have recently been the subject of renewed scholarly interest. Professor Rudd provides a clear introduction to each of the three poems: the Epistles to Augustus, to Florus, and to the Pisones (the so-called \"Ars Poetica\"). He sketches the historical context in which the poems were written and comments on their structure and purpose. He also discusses their literary preoccupations: the relations of poet and patron and the role of poetry in the state (Augustus), the problems of a professedly tiring poet (Florus), and the presentation of classical poetic theory (\"Ars Poetica\"). He notes Horace's influence on later criticism, drawing attention in one section to one of Alexander Pope's Imitations. He also addresses problems of grammar and style, focusing on linguistic difficulties and the subtle movement of the poet's thought.",

     "Simone Murray"

    "publisher": "Routledge",
    "publishedDate": "2012-03-12",
    "description": "Adaptation constitutes the driving force of contemporary culture, with stories adapted across an array of media formats. However, adaptation studies has been concerned almost exclusively with textual analysis, in particular with compare-and-contrast studies of individual novel and film pairings. This has left almost completely unexamined crucial questions of how adaptations come to be made, what are the industries with the greatest stake in making them, and who the decision-makers are in the adaptation process. The Adaptation Industry re-imagines adaptation not as an abstract process, but as a material industry. It presents the adaptation industry as a cultural economy of six interlocking institutions, stakeholders and decision-makers all engaged in the actual business of adapting texts: authors; agents; publishers; book prize committees; scriptwriters; and screen producers and distributors. Through trading in intellectual property rights to cultural works, these six nodal points in the adaptation network are tightly interlinked, with success for one party potentially auguring for success in other spheres. But marked rivalries between these institutional forces also exist, with competition characterizing every aspect of the adaptation process. This book constructs an overdue sociology of contemporary literary adaptation, never losing sight of the material and institutional dimensions of this powerful process.",

It creates a musing world, where the issues are philosophical but the focus is always on people, on our most private ways of balancing our accounts. The poems are psychological; tender and humane, and somehow ruthless. This is poetry that swarms with ideas, that revels in rhythmic intricacy and literary references, but is also clear as a bell, and tells marvelous stories.",

    "description": "The Vercelli Book is one of the oldest surviving collections of Old English homilies and poems, compiled in England in the tenth century. Preaching the Converted provides a sustained literary analysis of the book's prose homilies and demonstrates that they employ rhetorical techniques commonly associated with vernacular verse. The study argues that the dazzling textual complexity of these homilies rivals the most accomplished examples of Old English poetry. Highlighting the use of word play, verbal and structural repetition, elaborate catalogues, and figurative language, Samantha Zacher's study of the Vercelli Book fills a gap in the history of English preaching by foregrounding the significance of these prose homilies as an intermediary form. Also analyzing the Latin and vernacular sources behind the Vercelli texts to reveal the theological and formal interests informing the collection as a whole, Preaching the Converted is a rigorous examination of Old English homiletic rhetoric and poetics.",

    "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (2010) Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award (2009) Rae Armantrout has always organized her collections of poetry as though they were works in themselves. Versed brings two of these sequences together, offering readers an expanded view of the arc of her writing. The poems in the first section, Versed, play with vice and versa, the perversity of human consciousness. They flirt with error and delusion, skating on a thin ice that inevitably cracks: “Metaphor forms / a crust / beneath which / the crevasse of each experience.” Dark Matter, the second section, alludes to more than the unseen substance thought to make up the majority of mass in the universe. The invisible and unknowable are confronted directly as Armantrout's experience with cancer marks these poems with a new austerity, shot through with her signature wit and stark unsentimental thinking. Together, the poems of Versed part us from our assumptions about reality, revealing the gaps and fissures in our emotional and linguistic constructs, showing us ourselves where we are most exposed.

    "description": "Arion's Lyre examines how Hellenistic poetic culture adapted, reinterpreted, and transformed Archaic Greek lyric through a complex process of textual, cultural, and creative reception. Looking at the ways in which the poetry of Sappho, Alcaeus, Ibycus, Anacreon, and Simonides was preserved, edited, and read by Hellenistic scholars and poets, the book shows that Archaic poets often look very different in the new social, cultural, and political setting of Hellenistic Alexandria. For example, the Alexandrian Sappho evolves from the singer of Archaic Lesbos but has distinct associations and contexts, from Ptolemaic politics and Macedonian queens to the new phenomenon of the poetry book and an Alexandrian scholarship intent on preservation and codification. A study of Hellenistic poetic culture and an interpretation of some of the Archaic poets it so lovingly preserved, Arion's Lyre is also an examination of how one poetic culture reads another--and how modern readings of ancient poetry are filtered and shaped by earlier readings.",

National Book Award finalist, Iraq war veteran, novelist and poet Kevin Powers creates a deeply affecting portrait of a life shaped by war. Letter Composed During a Lull in the Fighting captures the many moments that comprise a soldier's life: driving down the Texas highway; waiting for the unknown in the dry Iraq heat; writing a love letter; listening to a mother recount her dreams. Written with evocative language and discernment, Powers's poetry strives to make sense of the war and its echoes through human experience. Just as The Yellow Birds was hailed as the \"first literary masterpiece produced by the Iraq war,\" this collection will make its mark as a powerful, enduring work (Los Angeles Times).",

    "description": "Young were the years when Ymir made his settlement, there was no sand nor sea nor cool waves; earth was nowhere nor the sky above, chaos yawned, grass was there nowhere. The sun turns black, earth sinks into the sea, the bright stars vanish from the sky; steam rises up in the conflagration, a high flame plays against heaven itself. Seeress's Prophecy 3, 57 The collection of Norse-Icelandic mythological and heroic poetry known as the Poetic Edda contains the great narratives of the creation of the world and the coming of Ragnarok, the Doom of the Gods. The mythological poems explore the wisdom of the gods and giants, narrating the adventures of the god Thor against the hostile giants and the gods' rivalries amongst themselves. The heroic poems trace the exploits of the hero Helgi and his valkyrie bride, the tragic tale of Sigurd and Brynhild's doomed love, and the terrible drama of Sigurd's widow Gudrun and her children. Many of the poems predate the conversion of Scandinavia to Christianity, allowing us to glimpse the pagan beliefs of the North. Since the rediscovery of the Poetic Edda in the seventeenth century, its poetry has fascinated artists as diverse as Thomas Gray, Richard Wagner, and Jorge Luis Borges. This is the first complete translation to be published in Britain for fifty years, and it includes a scholarly introduction, notes, a genealogy of the gods and giants, and an index of names.",

    "description": "Aurora Leigh is the foremost example of the mid-nineteenth-century poem of contemporary life. This verse-novel is a richly detailed representation of the early Victorian age. The social panorama extends from the slums of London, through the literary world, to the upper classes and a number of superb satiric portraits: an aunt with rigidly conventional notions of female education; Romney Leigh, the Christian socialist; Lord Howe, the amateur radical; Sir Blaise Delorme, the ostentatious Roman Catholic; and the unscrupulous society beauty Lady Waldemar. However, the dominant presence in the work is the narrator, Aurora Leigh herself. From early years in Italy and adolescence in the West Country to the vocational choices, creative struggles, and emotional entanglements of her first decade of adult life, Aurora Leigh develops her ideas on art, love, God, the Woman Question, and society. This is the first critically edited and fully annotated edition for almost a century. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

    "description": "The poetry and prose collected in Plainwater are a testament to the extraordinary imagination of Anne Carson, a writer described by Michael Ondaatje as \"the most exciting poet writing in English today.\" Succinct and astonishingly beautiful, these pieces stretch the boundaries of language and literary form, while juxtaposing classical and modern traditions. Carson envisions a present-day interview with a seventh-century BC poet, and offers miniature lectures on topics as varied as orchids and Ovid. She imagines the muse of a fifteenth-century painter attending a phenomenology conference in Italy. She constructs verbal photographs of a series of mysterious towns, and takes us on a pilgrimage in pursuit of the elusive and intimate anthropology of water. Blending the rhythm and vivid metaphor of poetry with the discursive nature of the essay, the writings in Plainwater dazzle us with their invention and enlighten us with their erudition.",

He regales his fellow pilgrims with the best tale he knows—a rude and raunchy tale that would be considered scandalous even by today’s standards. This special edition of “The Miller’s Tale,” one of the most memorable tales from Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, includes “The General Prologue,” “The Miller’s Prologue,” and “The Miller’s Tale,” in original Middle English and modern translated versions. HarperCollins brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperCollins short-stories collection to build your digital library.",

In this ground-breaking historical and cultural study of sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century lyric poetry, Marotti examines the interrelationship between the two systems of literary transmission and shows how in England manuscript and print publication together shaped the emerging institution of literature.",

    "description": "Mary Karr describes herself as a black-belt sinner, and this -- her fourth collection of poems --traces her improbable journey from the inferno of a tormented childhood into a resolutely irreverent Catholicism. Not since Saint Augustine wrote \"Give me chastity, Lord -- but not yet!\" has anyone brought such smart-assed hilarity to a conversion story. Karr's battle is grounded in common loss (a bitter romance, friends' deaths, a teenage son's leaving home) as well as in elegies for a complicated mother. The poems disarm with the arresting humor familiar to readers of her memoirs, The Liars' Club and Cherry. An illuminating cycle of spiritual poems have roots in Karr's eight-month tutelage in Jesuit prayer practice, and as an afterword, her celebrated essay on faith weaves the tale of how the language of poetry, which relieved her suffering so young, eventually became the language of prayer. Those of us who fret that poetry denies consolation will find clear-eyed joy in this collection.",

The first part of the epic, THE INFERNO, tells how the narrator \"loses his way,\" and finds himself in a strange landscape he's never seen before. There he encounters the shade of the ancient Roman poet, Virgil, who offers to lead him through the nine circles of Hell. The damned of Dante's imagination, it's quite clear, have condemned themselves through their actions or inactions to become permanent prisoners of the nether regions. Down, down, down, go Dante and his guide, meeting friend and foe alike, with horror piled upon horror. Finally, they must climb Satan's body to find the only possible exit from this terrible place--where once more the poet will \"see again the stars.\" A first-rate modern rendering of a literary classic!",

He conveys his thoughts from diverse standpoints: university-based analyst, essayist, satirist and humorist, and practical catalyst for creativity. According to Hau'ofa, only through creative originality in all fields of endeavor can the people of Oceania hope to strengthen their capacity to engage the forces of globalization.",

Inspired by the popularity of her interactive website, editor Sara Bynoe has compiled the definitive teen angst reader. Divided into 12 categories, including I am Alone and No One Understands My Pain and Obvious Metaphors, this book is for anyone who has ever written truly terrible, meditative, or self-indulgent poetry. Actually, this book is for anyone who survived being a teenager. All of the poets featured in this collection are now adults, living happy, angst-free lives. However, for this special book, they are willing to reveal excerpts from their old tattered notebooks or leather bound journals. Along with the poems, each poet has included a short introduction, giving background information for each work. As Sara Bynoe says, looking back on teen angst poetry brings people together in a \"poetry reading meets stand-up comedy meets AA\" sort of way.",

    "description": "This broad-ranging Companion gives readers a thorough grounding in both the background and the substance of eighteenth-century poetry in all its rich variety. An up-to-date and wide-ranging guide to eighteenth-century poetry. Reflects the dramatic transformation which has taken place in the study of eighteenth-century poetry over the past two decades. Opens with a section on contexts, discussing poetry's relationships with patriotism, politics, science, and the visual arts, for example. Discusses poetry by male and female poets from all walks of life. Includes numerous close readings of individual poems, ranging from Pope's The Rape of the Lock to Mary Collier's The Woman's Labour. Includes more provocative contributions on subjects such as rural poetry and the self-taught tradition, British poetry 'beyond the borders', the constructions of femininity, women as writers and women as readers. Designed to be used alongside David Fairer and Christine Gerrard's Eighteenth-century Poetry: An Annotated Anthology (Blackwell Publishing, Second Edition, 2003).",

Hardy's poems are by turn haunting, intense, songlike humerous and tender. From snatched lovers' meetings to the wreck of the Titanic from the death of a Dorest drummer boy in the Boer War to memories of his dead wife Emma, from ghosts, loss and longing to pleasure in landscape and weather, they tell the story of one of our best-loved writers, and the people and places that inspired him.",

A precarious dance between the spiritual and the material ensues, the lyric poem confronting a consumer culture overrun by rampant lust and greed yet finding itself unable to wholly stand outside of what it critiques. Any consolation found herein is short-lived. Even so, by extending the traditions of lyric poetry forward, these utterances seek to enlarge the conversation between art and life, anticipating whatever commerce the future might yet hold.",

    "description": "From the Nobel laureate, a book-length poem on two educations in painting, a century apart \"Between me and Venice the thigh of a hound; my awe of the ordinary, because even as I write, paused on a step of this couplet, I have never found its image again, a hound in astounding light.\" Tiepolo's Hound joins the quests of two Caribbean men: Camille Pissarro--a Sephardic Jew born in 1830 who leaves his native St. Thomas to follow his vocation as a painter in Paris--and the poet himself, who longs to rediscover a detail--\"a slash of pink on the inner thigh / of a white hound\"--of a Venetian painting encountered on an early visit from St. Lucia to New York. Both journeys take us through a Europe of the mind's eye, in search of a connection between the lost, actual landscape of a childhood and the mythical landscape of empire. Published with twenty-five full-color reproductions of Derek Walcott's own paintings, the poem is at once the spiritual biography of a great artist in self-imposed exile, a history in verse of Impressionist painting, and a memoir of the poet's desire to catch the visual world in more than words.",

    "description": "'we can speak of no greater contest than Olympia' The Greek poet Pindar (c. 518-428 BC) composed victory odes for winners in the ancient Games, including the Olympics. He celebrated the victories of athletes competing in foot races, horse races, boxing, wrestling, all-in fighting and the pentathlon, and his Odes are fascinating not only for their poetic qualities, but for what they tell us about the Games. Pindar praises the victor by comparing him to mythical heroes and the gods, but also reminds the athlete of his human limitations. The Odes contain versions of some of the best known Greek myths, such as Jason and the Argonauts, and Perseus and Medusa, and are a valuable source for Greek religion and ethics. Pindar's startling use of language - striking metaphors, bold syntax, enigmatic expressions - makes reading his poetry a uniquely rewarding experience. Anthony Verity's lucid translations are complemented by an introduction and notes that provide insight into competition, myth, and meaning. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

    "description": "Recently appointed as the new U. S. Poet Laureate, Ted Kooser has been writing and publishing poetry for more than forty years. In the pages of The Poetry Home Repair Manual, Kooser brings those decades of experience to bear. Here are tools and insights, the instructions (and warnings against instructions) that poets—aspiring or practicing—can use to hone their craft, perhaps into art. Using examples from his own rich literary oeuvre and from the work of a number of successful contemporary poets, the author schools us in the critical relationship between poet and reader, which is fundamental to what Kooser believes is poetry’s ultimate purpose: to reach other people and touch their hearts. Much more than a guidebook to writing and revising poems, this manual has all the comforts and merits of a long and enlightening conversation with a wise and patient old friend—a friend who is willing to share everything he’s learned about the art he’s spent a lifetime learning to execute so well.",

    "description": "Shane Neilson's accustomed fascination with the two great subjects, love and death, has an element of purely professional interest: he has written a poetry that fuses his poetic concerns with those of his profession as a physician. The poems in Complete Physical are primarily lyrics, but there is the occasional villanelle and sestina amidst a squalid sea of punchy narrative; all of the poems ponder what it means to be ill, and some of them celebrate what it means to recover. Some poems even consider the tragic point at which illness becomes identity. '...Doctors share one important thing with poets: an obsession with death. Shane Neilson has turned that obsession ù and the special deathwatching vantage of his medical trade ù into a collection of poems as beguiling and as brave as any I have recently read. In a clinical universe where suffering is distanced by language, Complete Physical becomes a kind of extraordinary talking cure. The human predicament has rarely found itself in such good hands.' ù Carmine Starnino The poems in Complete Physical address the most important question that the physical poses: How are we to live in this world? Neilson writes, 'The poems make that question tangential, they throw in details to make the poem fastenable...but they are always answering in earnest.' Neilson is a family physician who has written numerous books of poetry, all of which show fealty to his rural New Brunswick heritage.",

    "description": "Author Charles Ford continues to examine the philosophy of choice in the spirit of poetry by existentialism. Many themes are included, such as alienation, God, death, love, and so on. Here the list of themes is not exhausted. The roots of these choices are grounded in the will of the individual rather than his/her reason. He/she confronts problems that are seen in the world, so by his/her actions disclose human nature and reflect his/her latent dispositions. This is where inner choices must arise, so external choices may be seen as actions per se. When these state-of-affairs are closely examined, they disclosed aspects of the human condition. Experiences that revealed that we are human beings touching various realms of reality. For our inner/external choices say something about our makeup, we are wonderfully composed, and dynamically active from moment-to-moment of our existence. In Hidden Fields Book 3, Charles has written lots of poems in a personal way. He invites the readers to come along, and experience reality both mentally and through their senses. Every reader will soon discover something about him/ her with respect to choices that were made that he/she is fleshly human and is real. Charles wants to share and invite the reader into his home now.",

    "description": "This superb Pulitzer Prize–winning collection gives voice to failure with a wry, deft touch from one of this country’s most engaging and uncompromising poets. In Failure, Philip Schultz evokes the pleasures of family,marriage, beaches, and dogs; New York City in the 1970s; revolutions both interior and exterior; and the terrors of 9/11 with a compassion that demonstrates he is a master of the bittersweet and fierce, the wondrous and direct, and the brilliantly provocative. Filled with poems of \"heartbreaking tenderness that [go] beyond mere pity\" (Gerald Stern), Failure is a collection to savor from this major American poet.",

    "description": "Guillaume Apollinaire’s final years exactly coincided with the clamorous advent of European Modernism and with the cataclysms of WWI. In The Self-Dismembered Man, poet Donald Revell offers new English translations of the most powerful poems Apollinaire wrote during those years: poems of nascent surrealism, of combat and of war-weariness. Here, too, is Apollinaire’s last testament, “The Pretty Redhead,” a farewell to the epoch that he—as poet, convict, art-critic, artilleryman and boulevardier—did so much to conjure and sustain until his death on Armistice Day in 1918. Readers of Apollinaire’s more familiar early work, Alcools (Wesleyan, 1995), will find here a darker and yet more tender poet, a poet of the broken world who shares entirely the world’s catastrophe even as he praises to the end its glamour and its strange innocence. This English translation, facing the original French, illuminates Apollinaire’s crucial and continuing influence on the European and American avant-garde. The volume includes a short translator’s preface.",

After all, what could be more tantalizing than teaching the beautiful Witfeld sisters all the special ways of driving a man into submission—and marriage? And leading exquisite Caroline Witfeld, the most spirited and least frivolous sister, to temptation would be wildly delicious. Zachary doesn't realize that Caroline's longing gazes have less to do with attraction and more to do with admission—to a prestigious arts conservatory. If only she could set those high cheekbones, that aristocratic brow, and those powerful shoulders to canvas, her dreams would all come true. But Caroline is soon having dreams of a very different sort—ones that involve the charming rogue and some improper behavior hardly befitting a lady dedicated to her art . . .unless she becomes dedicated to the art of love.",

No one knows if Lijuan is dead or has chosen to Sleep the long sleep of an immortal. But with her lands falling into chaos under a rising tide of vampiric bloodlust, a mysterious and ancient order of angels known as the Luminata calls the entire Cadre together to discuss the fate of her territory. Accompanying her archangelic lover Raphael to the Luminata compound, guild hunter-turned-angel Elena senses that all is not as it seems. Secrets echo from within the stone walls of the compound, and the deeper Elena goes, the uglier the darkness. But neither Raphael nor Elena is ready for the brutal truths hidden within--truths that will change everything Elena thinks she knows about who she is... Nothing will ever be the same again.",

A battle of wills was raging in the Lone Star State in 1876. April Truitt didn't trust doctors - least of all handsome newcomer Gray Fuller who opposed her efforts to offer the women of Fignity, Texas an herbal alternative to surgery. He treated her like some quack. But April was determined to save other women from dying on the operating table like her mother did. Despite their differences, Gray couldn't help but admire April's spirit and good intentions. Yet he couldn't let this bluebonnet belle steal all of his patients - even if she was well on her way to stealing his heart. Lori Copeland is a CBA and USA Today bestselling author and the recipient of the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award and Reviewers' Choice Award.",

Hildegarda, Fausto, Plínio, Odília, Ulisses, Vanessa - cada um é examinado detidamente num capítulo próprio e apresentado de modo parcial e oblíquo nos capítulos referentes a outros personagens. Aqui, todos têm suas razões e sua loucura e cada destino refrata e matiza os outros. Organizando seus personagens em ordem alfabética, de Antônio a Zenóbia, Maria Esther Maciel joga com o formato dos dicionários de nomes, descobrindo ou inventando etimologias, erigindo crenças, teorias e clichês para dissipá-los logo em seguida.",

The police turn up only one clue: a mysterious rhyme signed Jack and Jill promising that this is just the beginning. Jack and Jill are out to get the rich and famous, and they will stop at nothing until their fiendish plan is carried out. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C., homicide detective Alex Cross is called to a murder scene only blocks from his house, far from the corridors of power where he spends his days. The victim: a beautiful little girl, savagely beaten - and deposited in front of the elementary school Cross's son, Damon, attends. Could there be a connection between the two murders? As Cross tries to put the pieces together, the killer - or killers - strike again. And again. No one in Washington is safe - not children, not politicians, not even the President of the United States. Only Alex Cross has the skills and the courage to crack the case - but will he discover the truth in time?",

    "description": "Desperate to become a priest in the Catholic Church, Aleksandra Kowalski turns to Thomas Patrick O'Reilly, one of the wealthiest and most successful trial lawyers in Houston, Texas. Tommy believes the Catholic Church has no basis under United States law to exclude women from the seminary and files suit against the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston and Archbishop Jorge Sierra for sex discrimination without justifiable cause. The Catholic Church hires Monsignor Enrico Renzulli, the General Counsel of the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops. Renzulli, a priest and Harvard-educated attorney, has substantial trial experience and has taken on and beaten lawyers considerably smarter than O'Reilly. He believes the lawsuit should be summarily dismissed because the First Amendment of the United States Constitution grants all citizens the freedom of religion, and it prevents a federal court from interfering with the ecclesiastical rules of any church, including the Catholic Church. But watching and waiting in the wings is an extreme and tyrannical sect unaffiliated with the Catholic Church. As the trial unfolds and the legal proceedings begin to undermine the sacred Catholic Church teaching, a right-wing extremist and a member of the Holy Mother Church concocts a plot to stop the heresy against God that includes kidnapping and murder. Will the First Amendment protect the Catholic Church and supersede all? Will Tommy O'Reilly come through? Will Aleksandra Kowalski survive this ordeal? Find out in R.A. Brown's gripping legal thriller,Created Equal.",

Several persons are suspected of the crime and the mysterious vagabond takes infinite delight in observing developments as they take place about him. When suspense reaches an almost unbearable climax, the vagabond is at last located by the keepers of a nearby Sanitorium and it is learned that he, a madman, has been responsible for the vastly amusing and complicated series of misunderstandings.",

    "description": "Much of today's writing on children treats the child of any age as a problem or a set of problems to be solved, effectively reducing the child to a complex of biological and chemical factors, explainable in scientific terms, or regarding children as objects of adult control. In contrast, Martin Marty here presents the child as a mystery who invokes wonder and elicits creative responses that affect the care provided him or her. Drawing on literature as new as contemporary poetry and as old as the Bible, The Mystery of the Child encourages the thoughtful enjoyment of children instead of the imposition of adult will and control. Indeed, Marty treats the impulse to control as a problem and highlights qualities associated with children -- responsiveness, receptivity, openness to wonder -- that can become sources of renewal for adults. The Mystery of the Child represents a new tack for Martin Marty -- universally respected as a historian, theologian, and interpreter of religion and culture -- but displays the same incisive, erudite quality marking the fifty-plus books and thousands of articles that he has previously written. Marty's broad, thoughtful perspective will inspire readers to think afresh about what it means to be a child -- and to be a caregiver. This book is sure to claim a wide readership -- parents, grandparents, schoolteachers, theologians, historians -- engaging anyone wanting to explore more fully the profound realm of the child.",

It is also an attitude that can be both healing and life-transforming, particularly in our \"awe-depleted\" age. Through an in depth focus on people's life stories (including that of the author), this volume explores the nature and power of awe for individuals, for societies, and for the potential course of humanity.",

    "description": "Science fiction is a literary genre based on scientific speculation. Works of science fiction use the ideas and the vocabulary of all sciences to create valid narratives that explore the future effects of science on events and human beings. Science Fact and Science Fiction examines in one volume how science has propelled science-fiction and, to a lesser extent, how science fiction has influenced the sciences. Although coverage will discuss the science behind the fiction from the Classical Age to the present, focus is naturally on the 19th century to the present, when the Industrial Revolution and spectacular progress in science and technology triggered an influx of science-fiction works speculating on the future. As scientific developments alter expectations for the future, the literature absorbs, uses, and adapts such contextual visions. The goal of the Encyclopedia is not to present a catalog of sciences and their application in literary fiction, but rather to study the ongoing flow and counterflow of influences, including how fictional representations of science affect how we view its practice and disciplines. Although the main focus is on literature, other forms of science fiction, including film and video games, are explored and, because science is an international matter, works from non-English speaking countries are discussed as needed.",

    "description": "Why do people respond emotionally to works of fiction they know are make-believe? Boruah tackles this question, which is fundamental aesthetics and literary studies, from a totally new perspective. Bringing together the various answers that have been offered by philosophers from Aristotle to Roger Scruton, he shows that while some philosophers have denied any rational basis to our emotional responses to fiction, others have argued that the emotions evoked by fiction are not real emotions at all. In response to this, Boruah contends that fictional emotions are rational because they are based on the same sorts of beliefs that we form about real situations and real people. He illustrates this argument with literary examples ranging from Shakespeare to Tolstoy.",

    "description": "Time Machines takes you on an exhilarating journey through the intriguing theories of scientists and the far-flung imaginations of writers. It explores the ideas of time travel from the first account in English literature to the latest theories of physicists such as Kip Thorne and Igor Novikov. This very readable work covers a variety of topics including the history of time travel in fiction; the fundamental scientific concepts of time, spacetime, and the fourth dimension; the speculations of Einstein, Richard Feynman, Kurt Gödel, and others; time travel paradoxes, and much more. For anyone who shares a fascination with time travel, Time Machines is an engrossing study of what writers have imagined and what scientists may some day make possible. \"Here's a gem of a book...all peppered with delightful notes...I can't turn a page without finding a jewel.\"Clifford Stoll, University of California, Berkeley, author of \"The Cuckoo's Egg\"\"...I have been struck by the richness and complexity of the tapestry of ideas that Nahin presents...may well remain the most readable and complete treatise on time travel in science and science fiction.\" Kip S. Thorne, The Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, California Institute of Technology\"if, like me, you are a child at heart, the real fun lies in the zany stories and wild speculations\" Physics World",

    "description": "Science fiction is the playground of the imagination. If you are interested in science or fascinated with the future then science fiction is where you explore new ideas and let your dreams and nightmares duke it out on the safety of the page or screen. But what if we could use science fiction to do more than that? What if we could use science fiction based on science fact to not only imagine our future but develop new technologies and products? What if we could use stories, movies and comics as a kind of tool to explore the real world implications and uses of future technologies today? Science Fiction Prototyping is a practical guide to using fiction as a way to imagine our future in a whole new way. Filled with history, real world examples and conversations with experts like best selling science fiction author Cory Doctorow, senior editor at Dark Horse Comics Chris Warner and Hollywood science expert Sidney Perkowitz, Science Fiction Prototyping will give you the tools you need to begin designing the future with science fiction. The future is Brian David Johnson's business. As a futurist at Intel Corporation, his charter is to develop an actionable vision for computing in 2021. His work is called \"future casting\"-using ethnographic field studies, technology research, trend data, and even science fiction to create a pragmatic vision of consumers and computing. Johnson has been pioneering development in artificial intelligence, robotics, and reinventing TV. He speaks and writes extensively about future technologies in articles and scientific papers as well as science fiction short stories and novels (Fake Plastic Love and Screen Future: The Future of Entertainment, Computing and the Devices We Love). He has directed two feature films and is an illustrator and commissioned painter. Table of Contents: Preface / Foreword / Epilogue / Dedication / Acknowledgments / 1. The Future Is in Your Hands / 2.

    "description": "Currently, science fiction in all its forms is enjoying enormous popular interest. There can be no doubt that science fiction books and films have great influence on the public view of science and scientists. Close Encounters? examines the historical development of science fiction as a genre in books and films, tracing its roots, examining its most common ideas, exploring its relationship to \"real\" science, and attempting to assess its cultural impact. Discussion focuses on major themes such as time travel, politics, religion, ecology, and disasters. The authors consider the science in science fiction, the images of scientists that science fiction conveys, and some of the political, religious, and social motifs prominent in science fiction. They also discuss pseudo-science and its growing influence on the public perception of science. This fascinating, thought-provoking study should be read by all those interested in how the nature of science and its role in our society is portrayed in science fiction.",

    "description": "What can we learn about the world from engaging with fictional time-series? What should we make of stories involving time travellers who change the past, recurrence of a single day, foreknowledge of the future, the freezing or rewinding of time, or time-series which split into alternative courses of events? Do they show us radical alternative possibilities concerning the nature of time, or do they show that even the impossible can be represented in fiction? Neither, so this book argues. Defending the view that a fiction represents a single possible world, the authors show how apparent representations of radically different time-series can be explained in terms of how worlds are represented without there being any fictional world which has such a time-series. In this way, the book uses the complexities of fictional time to get to the core of the relation between truth in fiction and possibility. It provides a logic and metaphysics to deal with the fact that fictions can leave certain features of their fictional worlds indefinite, and draws comparisons and connections between fictional and scientific representations and hypotheses. Utilising the notion of a counterpart, the authors show how to understand claims concerning persistence of characters and their identity across fictions, and what it means for a fiction to be 'set' at an actual time. Consideration is given to motion in fiction, asking whether it is sometimes continuous and sometimes discrete, how to understand different rates of change, and whether fictional time itself can be said to flow.",

    "description": "The material in this book forms the basis of an interdisciplinary, college-level course, which uses science fiction film as a vehicle for exploring science concepts. Unlike traditional introductory-level courses, the science content is arranged according to major themes in science fiction, with a deliberate progression from the highly objective and discipline-specific (e.g. Reference Frames; Physics of Space Travel and Time Travel) to the very multi-disciplinary and thought-provoking (e.g. Human Teleportation; Science and Society). Over 100 references to science fiction films and television episodes are included, spanning more than 100 years of cinematic history. Some of these are conducive to calculations (solutions included).",

    "description": "In this new and timely cultural history of science fiction, Roger Luckhurst examines the genre from its origins in the late nineteenth century to its latest manifestations. The book introduces and explicates major works of science fiction literature by placing them in a series of contexts, using the history of science and technology, political and economic history, and cultural theory to develop the means for understanding the unique qualities of the genre. Luckhurst reads science fiction as a literature of modernity. His astute analysis examines how the genre provides a constantly modulating record of how human embodiment is transformed by scientific and technological change and how the very sense of self is imaginatively recomposed in popular fictions that range from utopian possibility to Gothic terror. This highly readable study charts the overlapping yet distinct histories of British and American science fiction, with commentary on the central authors, magazines, movements and texts from 1880 to the present day. It will be an invaluable guide and resource for all students taking courses on science fiction, technoculture and popular literature, but will equally be fascinating for anyone who has ever enjoyed a science fiction book.",

    "description": "This book explores concepts of rationality drawn from philosophy and the social sciences, in relation to traditions of literary enquiry. The author surveys basic assumptions and questions in philosophical accounts of action, in decision theory, and in the theory of rational choice. He gives examples ranging from Icelandic sagas to Poe and Beckett, and examines some situations and actions drawn from American and European fiction in order to analyze issues raised by contemporary models of agency. Challenging poststructuralism's irrationalist images of science, this innovative study crosses the boundary between literary and philosophical studies in a bold interdisciplinary spirit.",

    "description": "Since its emergence in the seventeenth century, science fiction has been a sustained, coherent and subversive check on the promises and pitfalls of science. In their turn, invention and discovery have forced fiction writers to confront the nature and limits of reality. Different Engines explores how this fascinating symbiosis shapes what we see, do, and dream. From Johannes Kepler's Somnium to Arthur C. Clarke's 2001, science fiction has emerged as a mode of thinking, complementary to the scientific method. Science fiction's field of interest is the gap between the new worlds uncovered by experimentation and exploration, and the fantastic worlds of the imagination. Its proponents find drama in the tension between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Its readers, many of them scientists and politicians, find inspiration in the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Brake and Hook's Different Engines is a unique, provocative and compelling account of science fiction as the arbiter of progress.",

Each chapter demonstrates that both science and fiction were vital parts of a culture of imaginative and empirical practices that were continually reacting to, arguing with, and influencing one another throughout the nineteenth century. In a narrative that cites classic science fiction texts, Willis establishes a timeline for the reader so that the cultural significance of science fiction is understood and its complexity and relevance to the nineteenth century is demonstrated.\" \"Those interested in nineteenth-century history and literature, cultural studies, the history of science, and science fiction will welcome this addition to the scholarship.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

    "description": "Ozone-friendly, recyclable, zero-waste, elimination of toxic chemicals - such environmental ideals are believed to offer solutions to the environmental crisis. Where do these ideals come from? Is the environmental debate communicating the right problems? Eco-Facts and Eco-Fiction examines serious errors in perceptions about human and environmental health. Drawing on a wealth of everyday examples of local and global concerns, the author explains basic concepts and observations relating to the environment. Removing fear of science and technology and eliminating wrong perceptions lead to a more informed understanding of the environment as a science, a philosophy, and a lifestyle. By revealing the flaws in today's environmental vocabulary, this book stresses the urgent need for a common language in the environmental debate. Such a common language encourages the effective communication between environmental science and environmental decision-making that is essential for finding solutions to environmental problems.",

The book includes analyses of such neglected works as The Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the Peak, and Woodstock, as well as the more frequently studied Rob Roy, The Heart of Midlothian, and Redgauntlet. Offering fresh insight into the variety and complexity of Scott's novels, and into the traditions of criticism which have so often obscured them, Legitimate Histories makes an important contribution to the study of Romanticism, the novel, and to current theoretical debates concerning historical fiction and historiographic authority.",

    "description": "The great biologist Louis Pasteur suppressed 'awkward' data because it didn't support the case he was making. John Snow, the 'first epidemiologist' was doing nothing others had not done before. Gregor Mendel, the supposed 'founder of genetics' never grasped the fundamental principles of 'Mendelian' genetics. Joseph Lister's famously clean hospital wards were actually notorious dirty. And Einstein's general relativity was only 'confirmed' in 1919 because an eminent British scientist cooked his figures. These are just some of the revelations explored in this book. Drawing on current history of science scholarship, Fabulous Science shows that many of our greatest heroes of science were less than honest about their experimental data and not above using friends in high places to help get their ideas accepted. It also reveals that the alleged revolutionaries of the history of science were often nothing of the sort. Prodigiously able they may have been, but the epithet of the 'man before his time' usually obscures vital contributions made their unsung contemporaries and the intrinsic merits of ideas they overturned. These distortions of the historical record mostly arise from our tendency to read the present back into the past. But in many cases, scientists owe their immortality to a combination of astonishing effrontery and their skills as self-promoters.",

    "description": "Here, in a new edition, is Nelson Goodman's provocative philosophical classic--a book that, according to Science, \"raised a storm of controversy\" when it was first published in 1954, and one that remains on the front lines of philosophical debate. How is it that we feel confident in generalizing from experience in some ways but not in others? How are generalizations that are warranted to be distinguished from those that are not? Goodman shows that these questions resist formal solution and his demonstration has been taken by nativists like Chomsky and Fodor as proof that neither scientific induction nor ordinary learning can proceed without an a priori, or innate, ordering of hypotheses. In his new foreword to this edition, Hilary Putnam forcefully rejects these nativist claims. The controversy surrounding these unsolved problems is as relevant to the psychology of cognitive development as it is to the philosophy of science. No serious student of either discipline can afford to misunderstand Goodman's classic argument.",

Many of the most fascinating ideas in science originated not in the laboratory but in the minds of such science fiction writers as Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury. The former's 1945 article on communications satellites was the original idea behind modern satellites; the latter's Martian Chronicles has been attributed as the main inspiration behind NASA's many missions to Mars. From bionics to black holes and warp factors to worm holes, this is the quintessential guide to the many links between science fiction and science reality.",

Is the time travel portrayed in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home a real possibility? Discover the surprising answers to these and a host of other intriguing questions in Fantastic Voyages. This book provides basic physics and biology instruction using scenes from popular science fiction films as examples of the concepts discussed. Scenes are discussed from such sci-fi classics as The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes and The Andromeda Strain. The latter includes study questions on biological terrorism. More recent hit films discussed include Contact, Jurassic Park and Independence Day. The book is divided into three sections: basic physics and astronomy for non-science majors selected topics in biology detailed plot descriptions of 42 films The new edition also contains material about the greenhouse effect, nuclear power and nuclear terrorism, and the effects of an impact from a comet or asteroid. Acclaim for the previous edition: \"If you find science fiction films thought-provoking, this could be the book for you...The scope of the book is wide, with a good grounding in basic physics and biology, and a lot of other information besides.\" –New Scientist \"The idea of using science fiction films to convey science in an interesting way is sound, and anyone preparing a course using the genre should at least consult this book.\" –Nature ABOUT THE AUTHORS Leroy W. Dubeck is Professor of Physics at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Suzanne E. Moshier is Professor of Biology at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. Judith E.

    "description": "The human impulse is to explore, and now there is an unexplored territory open for the traveler. The arrival of a revolutionary, safe, and environmentally friendly flying machine called SpaceShipTwo makes suborbital space travel a reality. For the first time, passenger astronauts are able to pay for a ride into space on a commercial space flight.

    "description": "Can literary fictions convey significant philosophical views, understood in terms of propositional knowledge? This study addresses the philosophical value of literature by examining how literary works impart philosophy truth and knowledge and to what extent the works should be approached as communications of their authors. Beginning with theories of fiction, it examines the case against the prevailing 'pretence' and 'make-believe' theories of fiction hostile to propositional theories of literary truth. Tackling further arguments against the cognitive function and value of literature, this study illustrates how literary works can contribute to knowledge by making assertions and suggestions and by providing hypotheses for the reader to assess. Through clear analysis of the concept of the author, the role of the authorial intention and the different approaches to the 'meaning' of a literary work, this study provides an historical survey to the cognitivist-anti-cognitivist dispute, introducing contemporary trends in the discussion before presenting a novel approach to recognizing the cognitive function of literature. An important contribution to philosophical studies of literature and knowledge.",

    "description": "While Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau are often credited with inventing American environmental writing, Matthew Wynn Sivils argues that the works of these Transcendentalists must be placed within a larger literary tradition that has its origins in early Republic natural histories, Indian captivity narratives, Gothic novels, and juvenile literature. Authors such as William Bartram, Ann Eliza Bleecker, and Samuel Griswold Goodrich, to name just a few, enabled the development of a credibly American brand of proto-environmental fiction. Sivils argues that these seeds of environmental literature would come to fruition in James Fenimore Cooper’s The Pioneers, which he argues is the first uniquely environmental American novel. He then connects the biogeographical politics of Cooper’s The Prairie with European anti-Americanism; and concludes this study by examining how James Kirke Paulding, Thomas Cole, and James Fenimore Cooper imaginatively addressed the problem of human culpability and nationalistic cohesiveness in the face of natural disasters. With their focus on the character and implications of the imagined American landscape, these key works of early environmental thought contributed to the growing influence of the natural environment on the identity of the fledgling nation decades before the influences of Emerson's Nature and Thoreau's Walden.",

    "publishedDate": "2008",
    "description": "This book examines the making of human cloning as an imaginary practice and scientific fact. It explores the controversies surrounding both ‘therapeutic cloning’ for stem cell research and ‘reproductive’ cloning. The authors analyse the cultural production of cloning, how practices and representations play out in the global arena, and its transformation from science fiction to science practice. Case studies are used to illustrate key fore grounded issues: the image of the scientist, scientific expertise and institutions the governance of science the representation of women’s bodies as the subjects and objects of biotechnology the constitution of publics, both as objects of media debate, and as their intended audience. Drawing together the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge, with insights from media and cultural studies, this book offers a timely contribution to debates about the public communication of science and the status of scientific truth. This book will be a valuable companion to students on undergraduate courses in media studies, science communication, cultural studies, science and technology studies and sociology.",

    "description": "The second edition of Stem Cells: Scientific Facts and Fiction provides the non-stem cell expert with an understandable review of the history, current state of affairs, and facts and fiction of the promises of stem cells. Building on success of its award-winning preceding edition, the second edition features new chapters on embryonic and iPS cells and stem cells in veterinary science and medicine. It contains major revisions on cancer stem cells to include new culture models, additional interviews with leaders in progenitor cells, engineered eye tissue, and xeno organs from stem cells, as well as new information on \"organs on chips\" and adult progenitor cells. In the past decades our understanding of stem cell biology has increased tremendously. Many types of stem cells have been discovered in tissues that everyone presumed were unable to regenerate in adults, the heart and the brain in particular. There is vast interest in stem cells from biologists and clinicians who see the potential for regenerative medicine and future treatments for chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, and spinal cord lesions, based on the use of stem cells; and from entrepreneurs in biotechnology who expect new commercial applications ranging from drug discovery to transplantation therapies. Explains in straightforward, non-specialist language the basic biology of stem cells and their applications in modern medicine and future therapy Includes extensive coverage of adult and embryonic stem cells both historically and in contemporary practice Richly illustrated to assist in understanding how research is done and the current hurdles to clinical practice",

    "description": "Fact or Fiction: Science Tackles 58 Popular Myths by the Editors of Scientific American Did NASA really spend millions creating a pen that would write in space? Is chocolate poisonous to dogs? Does stress cause gray hair? These questions are just a sample of the urban lore investigated in this eBook, Fact or Fiction: Science Tackles 58 Popular Myths. Drawing from Scientific American's \"Fact or Fiction\" and \"Strange But True\" columns, we've selected 58 of the most surprising, fascinating, useful and just plain wacky topics confronted by our writers over the years. Each brief article uncovers the truth behind everyday mythology, starting with Section One, \"In the Animal Kingdom,\" where we examine some of the more outlandish claims about our fellow earthly inhabitants, such as whether elephants really remember everything and whether a cockroach can live without its head. Other sections cover reproduction, the environment, technology and personal and mental health. While the answers to some questions, such as whether toilets really do flush in the opposite direction south of the Equator, may only serve to raise your Trivial Pursuit knowledge, others, such as whether to pee on a jellyfish sting or wake a sleepwalker, may come in handy. Although this eBook represents a fraction of circulating folk wisdom and urban mythology, we hope that it's an enjoyable fraction and that it encourages you to do some debunking yourself.",
